== Planned for a future release
=== Breaking

== Unreleased
These changes are merged into the `main` branch, but have not been released. After merging pull requests (PRs) that are not immediately released into `main`, a tag is added appending the PR# to the current release. For example, if the release version/tag is `3.2.1`, and PR# 107 is merged without a new release, the state of the codebase after that merge will be tagged as `3.2.1.107`.
